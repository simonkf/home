		<h2>Crystal Mimicry</h2>
		<h3>What My Power Is</h3>
		<p>Crystal Mimicry is the ability to transform my body completely into crystal or crystalline substance. My transformed form is anatomically identical to my normal form. I am immune to any form of toxins, venom, viruses, bacteria, allergens and diseases. I can protect myself by creating dermal body armour; which is resistant to attacks, harm or pain and temperature extremes. I have the power to utilize weapons that I can create naturally with my powers. I can neutralize my sensitivity to physical pain; which comes in handy in my line of work. I have a high physical durability, allowing me to take numerous blows of internal or external assaults before succumbing to the effects and I have enhanced strength. My lungs are powerful allowing me to breathe underwater. I can resist high intensities of light and heat.</p>
		<h3>How I Obtained My Powers</h3>
		<p>My powers are passed down as a mantle to worthy family members in every generation and I've been training to be the next worthy family member of my generation. I had to prove myself worthy in all forms of combat and mental training. Finally, I was given the gemstone that allowed me to use my powers at a full maximum.</p>
		<h3>My Job</h3>
		<p>I work as an agent for an extra-governmental military counter-terrorism and intelligence agency, tasked with maintaining global security. I'm tasked with helping counter terrorism and shut down illegal organizations; like Hydra. I also go on secret missions around the world. I'm only allowed to use my powers for the good of mankind and not for my own personal gain.</p>
